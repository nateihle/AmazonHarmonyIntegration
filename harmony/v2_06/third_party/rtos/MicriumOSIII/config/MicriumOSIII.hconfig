	Compile-time configuration allows users to determine which features to enable and those features that are not needed. With compile-time configuration, the code and data sizes of uC/OS-III (i.e., its footprint) can be reduced by enabling only the desired functionality.</div>

<p><strong>uC/OS-III - Use application specific hooks</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Specifies that application-defined hooks can be called from uC/OS-III's hooks. This allows the application code to extend the functionality of uC/OS-III. </div>
<div>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	It's also up to a user to set pointer values to point to the appropriate application-defined hook functions. The pointers do not have to be set in main() but, you can set them after calling OSInit().</div>
<div>

<div>
	Note that not every hook function need to be defined, only the ones the user wants to place in the application code.</div>
<div>

<div>
	Also, if you don't intend to extend uC/OS-III's hook through these application hooks, you can disable this setting to save RAM (i.e., the pointers)</div>

<p><strong>uC/OS-III - Use argument checking</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Determines whether the user wants most of uC/OS-III functions to perform argument checking. When selected, uC/OS-III ensures that pointers passed to functions are non-NULL, that arguments passed are within allowable range, that options are valid, and more. When disabled, those arguments are not checked and the amount of code space and processing time required by uC/OS-III is reduced. You would disable this option only if you are certain that the arguments are correct.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	uC/OS-III performs argument checking in over 40 functions. Therefore, you can save a few hundred bytes of code space by disabling this check. However, you should always enable argument checking until you are certain the code can be trusted.</div>

    default y
    ---help---
<p><strong>uC/OS-III - Use check for called from ISR</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Determines whether most of uC/OS-III functions are to confirm that the function is not called from an ISR. In other words, most of the functions from uC/OS-III should be called by task-level code except "post" type functions (which can also be called from ISRs). By setting this option, uC/OS-III is told to make sure that functions that are only supposed to be called by tasks are not called by ISRs. It's highly recommended to select this option until you are absolutely certain that the code is behaving correctly and that task-level functions are always called from tasks. You can disable this option to save code space and, of course, processing time.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	uC/OS-III performs this check in approximately 50 functions. Therefore, you can save a few hundred bytes of code space by disabling this check.</div>
<div>

<p><strong>uC/OS-III - Use debug code/variables</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Adds ROM constants located in os_dbg.c to help support kernel aware debuggers. Specifically, a number of named ROM variables can be queried by a debugger to find out about compiled-in options. For example, a debugger can find out the size of an OS_TCB, uC/OS-III's version number, the size of an event flag group (OS_FLAG_GRP), and much more.</div>

<p><strong>uC/OS-III - Use deferred ISR posts</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Reduces interrupt latency since interrupts are not disabled during most critical sections of code within uC/OS-III. Instead, the scheduler is locked during the processing of these critical sections. The advantage of enabling this option is that interrupt latency is lower; however, ISR to task response is slightly higher.</div>
<div>

<p><strong>uC/OS-III - Use object type checking</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Determines whether most of uC/OS-III functions should check to see if the function is manipulating the proper object. In other words, if attempting to post to a semaphore, is the user in fact passing a semaphore object or another object by mistake? It is recommended to enable this option until absolutely certain that the code is behaving correctly and the user code is always pointing to the proper objects. You would disable this option to save code space as well as data space. uC/OS-III object type checking is done nearly 30 times, and it is possible to save a few hundred bytes of code space and processing time by disabling this check.</div>
<div>

    default 8
    ---help---
<p><strong>uC/OS-III - The maximum number of task priorities</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Specifies the maximum number of priorities available in the application. Setting this option to just the number of priorities the user intends to use, reduces the amount of RAM needed by uC/OS-III</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In uC/OS-III, task priorities can range from 0 (highest priority) to a maximum of 255 (lowest possible priority) when the data type OS_PRIO is defined as a CPU_INT08U. However, in uC/OS-III, there is no practical limit to the number of available priorities. Specifically, if defining OS_PRIO as a CPU_INT16U, there can be up to 65536 priority levels. It is recommended to leave OS_PRIO defined as a CPU_INT08U and use only 256 different priority levels (i.e., 0..255), which is generally sufficient for every application. You should always set the maximum number of task priorities to even multiples of 8 (8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc.). The higher the number of different priorities, the more RAM uC/OS-III will consume.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	MHC sets the uC/OS-III preprocessor variable OS_CFG_PRIO_MAX to the maximum number of task priorities.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	An application cannot create tasks with a priority number higher than or equal to OS_CFG_PRIO_MAX. In fact, uC/OS-III reserves priority OS_CFG_PRIO_MAX-2 and OS_CFG_PRIO_MAX-1 for itself; OS_CFG_PRIO_MAX-1 is reserved for the idle task OS_IdleTask(). Additionally, do not use priority 0 for an application since it is reserved by uC/OS-III's ISR handler task. The priorities of the application tasks can therefore take a value between 2 and OS_CFG_PRIO_MAX–3 (inclusive).</div>

<p><strong>uC/OS-III - Minimum allowable task stack size</strong></p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This value specifies the minimum stack size (in CPU_STK elements) for each task. This is used by uC/OS-III to verify that sufficient stack space is provided for when each task is created. Suppose the full context of a processor consists of 16 registers of 32 bits. Also, suppose CPU_STK is declared as being of type CPU_INT32U, at a bare minimum, set OS_CFG_STK_SIZE_MIN to 16. However, it would be quite unwise to not accommodate for storage of local variables, function call returns, and possibly nested ISRs. Refer to the "port" of the processor used to see how to set this minimum. Again, this is a safeguard to make sure task stacks have sufficient stack space.</div>

<div>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	When enabled, OS_StatTask() executes at a rate of OS_CFG_STAT_TASK_RATE_HZ (see os_cfg_app.h), and computes the value of OSStatTaskCPUUsage, which is a variable that contains the percentage of CPU used by the application. OS_StatTask() calls OSStatTaskHook() every time it executes so that the user can add their own statistics as needed. See os_stat.c for details on the statistic task. The priority of OS_StatTask() is configurable by the application code (see os_cfg_app.h).</div>
<div>

/*******************************************************************************
  CAN Driver Interface Declarations for Static Single Instance Driver

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    drv_can_static.h

  Summary:
    CAN driver interface declarations for the static single instance driver.

  Description:
    The CAN device driver provides a simple interface to manage the CAN
    modules on Microchip microcontrollers. This file defines the interface
    Declarations for the CAN driver.

  Remarks:
    Static interfaces incorporate the driver instance number within the names
    of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or object handle.

    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.

PIC32 Bluetooth Starter Kit APP Eclipse Configuration Procedure

1. Import this project to Eclipse.
2. Add the Android Support Library to Eclipse by following the steps described in
   https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html to set up the libraries. 
   (located In 'Adding Support Libraries section', follow the 'Adding libraries with resources' subtitle)
3. Connect to a real Android Device instead of using an Android Virtual Device (AVD), as AVD may not 
   support Bluetooth.
4. Build the project to the Android Device, which should run as expected.
